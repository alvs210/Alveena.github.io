In me, the street-lamps\nShall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the\nWedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured\nSkirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,\nAnd in me the dying mother with hopeful\nEyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown\nAnd gone away to other towns, other arms.\" \n",

Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with \nLong braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and \nThey dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green \nTattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some \nWere dark and some were almost fair. Their voices \nWere harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of \nLovers dying and or children left unborn.... \nSome beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts \nAnd wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They \nWere thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from \nFuneral pyres, a drought and a rottenness \nWere in each of them. Even the crows were so \nSilent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; \nAll were watching these poor creatures' convulsions \nThe sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning \nAnd rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in \nAttics and the urine of lizards and mice.... \n\n\n\n",

                "The Old Playhouse\n\nYou planned to tame a swallow, to hold her\nIn the long summer of your love so that she would forget\nNot the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but\nAlso her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless\nPathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge\nOf yet another man that I came to you but to learn\nWhat I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every\nLesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased\nWith my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow\nConvulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured\nYourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed\nMy poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife,\nI was taught to break saccharine into your tea and\nTo offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering\nBeneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and\nBecame a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your\nQuestions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer\nBegins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes\nOf the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is\nAlways lit by artificial lights, your windows always\nShut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little,\nAll pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers\nIn the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is\nNo more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old\nPlayhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is\nAlways the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,\nFor, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted\nBy its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last\nAn end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors\nTo shatter and the kind night to erase the water. \n\n\n\n\n",

With loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, \nYou stick a finger into my dreaming eye. And \nYet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink \nLike white suns in the swell of my Dravidian blood, \nSecretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. \nWhen you leave, I drive my blue battered car \nAlong the bluer sea. I run up the forty \nNoisy steps to knock at another's door. \nThough peep-holes, the neighbours watch, \nthey watch me come \nAnd go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me \nWhat he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, \nA libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake \nBefore it clasps my pubis. Ask me why like \nA great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, \nAnd sleeps. Ask me why life is short and love is \nShorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price....\n\n\n\n\n",

It could\nhave been a very poisonous cobra. Very\n\nquickly, I chose my mode of attack: Acid.\nStaggering, I reached for the glass bottle\nso that I could pour the yellow-green cheap\nacid on its slimy body, burning it to death.\n\n\u201cStop it\u201d, the snake hissed in pure Tamil\nconnecting with me in the language of\nmy prayer and poetry. \u201cI am an exile.\u201d\nAnd I configured mental images of political\n\nrefugees. It wriggled out and I saw that\nit was balding, almost Rushdie-like, perhaps\nwith a death sentence too. Controversy was a\ncrowd pulling catch-phrase, to which I dutifully\n\nsuccumbed. Acid bottle in hand, I heard the\nsnake preach to me about living in detachment.\n\u201cThe perfection of life is when you do not\nknow the difference between yielding and\n\nresisting.\u201d The scrawny being writhed further\nand told me of rebirth and reincarnation. Being\na writer I really wanted to take notes. Instead\nI began arguing. \u201cShut up\u201d, the snake said to me,\n\n\u201cKarma and the whole stuff that follows it is just\nbunkum. You, a crazed agnostic, disagree because\nof borrowed ideas.\u201d Sharp movements of the red\ntongue terrified me. Almost sensing my fear, it\n\nsaid, \u201cYou could never challenge what you do\nnot comprehend.\u201d The snake spoke in circles, in\npatterns that could only resemble a snake\nswallowing its tail. Whatever. And then it\n\noccurred to me: Speech was the oldest trap,\nthe charming deceiver, persuasion\u2019s weapon\nand Satan\u2019s first area of expertise. \u201cStop it\u201d,\nthis time I said the words. \u201cTell me just your\n\nstory. Save the cant and rant for critical times.\u201d\nMy acidic tone gained me a menacing status\nand I continued, \u201cYou are a mean serpent.\nInstigator. Trouble-maker. Sly liar. Undulating\n\ntemptation-provider. Unworthy reminder\nof the seduction of strength over matter.\u201d It\nprotested in a booming resonant voice, \u201cNo, I\nam not any of this. I am just an exile, from\n\nparadise. Because of your Catholic upbringing,\nyou don\u2019t even know about the paradise lost\nin Hinduism.\u201d Who bothered for history or\nheritage, except shriveling snakes and failed\n\nwriters? At least, we both had something in\ncommon. \u201cLook here comrade, my credentials\nare different. In heaven, I was an activist. An\navid dissenter. Before the accession to heaven,\n\nlong long ago, I was a mighty monarch on earth,\nfeared and respected. I was Nahusa the Great.\nMy subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous.\nAnd I ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day\n\nwhen I decided that I could take leave of life. In\nheaven too, I was venerated. But one question had\nplagued me all the years of my long life, and it still\ntormented me in heaven. I wanted to know why\n\ncaste was there, why people suffered because of\ntheir karmas. I questioned the Gods, and the learned\nsages there. I asked them what would happen if an\nhigh-born did manual work just like the low-born.\n\nI worried about the division of labor, this disparity\nin dreams and destinies. You could say I was a rebel\npleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. I had a riotous\nhistory of revolution. The Gods plotted against me,\n\ndecided that I was trouble. I was cursed to turn into\na vile snake. I was banished from paradise. For sixty\nmillion years, I shall roam the earth, and then I may\nreturn.\u201d This was a different case of the paradise lost.\n\nIn this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second\nfickle-minded woman. Tradition triumphed over reason\nand the good were cast away. I let the serpent go,\nhappy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or\n\nperhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. I began\nto respect snakes \u2014 the challengers of hierarchy.\nWhile I gave him the freedom of safe passage\nI vowed never to kill serpents. Much later\n\nI realized brutally that this was just another\noccupational hazard for choosing a life\nwhere I was to be showing solidarity\nwith activists and dissenters.\n\n\n\n\n",

stars.\n\nThough he holds in his arms the earth-bride,\nthe sky is ever immensely away.\n\nGod seeks comrades and claims love,\nthe Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.\n\nThe soil in return for

child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,\nunobscured by the dust of history.\n\nAlight laughter in the steps of creation\ncarries it swiftly across time.\n\nOne who was distant came near to me in the morning,\nand still nearer when taken away by night.\n\nWhite and pink oleanders meet\nand make merry in different dialects.\n\nWhen peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.\n\nThe lake lies low by the hill,\na tearful entreaty of love\nat the foot of the inflexible.\n\nThere smiles the Divine Child\namong his playthings of unmeaning clouds\nand ephemeral lights and shadows.\n\nThe breeze whispers to the lotus,\n\"What is thy secret?\"\n\"It is myself,\" says the lotus,\n\"Steal it and I disappear!\"\n\nThe freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem\njoin hands in the dance of swaying branches.\n\nThe jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.\n\nThe tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom\nand yet to keep it for himself.\n\nGods, tired of their paradise, envy man.\n\nClouds are hills in vapour,\nhills are clouds in stone, \u2014\na phantasy in time's dream.\n\nWhile God waits for His temple to be built of love,\nmen bring stones.\n\nI touch God in my song\nas the hill touches the far-away sea\nwith its waterfall.\n\nLight finds her treasure of colours\nthrough the antagonism of clouds.\n\nMy heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears\nlike a wet tree glistening in the sun \nafter the rain is over.\n\nI have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,\nbut have failed to remember the grass\nthat has ever kept it green.\n\nThe one without second is emptiness,\nthe other one makes it true.\n\nLife's errors cry for the merciful beauty\nthat can modulate their isolation\ninto a harmony with the whole.\n\nThey expect thanks for the banished nest\nbecause their cage is shapely and secure.\n\nIn love I pay my endless debt to thee\nfor what thou art.\n\nThe pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,\nand the sun says, they are good.\n\nYour calumny against the great is impious,\nit hurts yourself;\nagainst the small it is mean,\nfor it hurts the victim.\n\nThe first flower that blossomed on this earth\nwas an invitation to the unborn song.\n\nDawn\u2014the many-coloured flower\u2014fades,\nand then the simple light-fruit,\nthe sun appears.\n\nThe muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom\nthrottles the voice that would cry.\n\nThe wind tries to take the flame by storm \nonly to blow it out.\n\nLife's play is swift,\nLife's playthings fall behind one by one\nand are forgotten.\n\nMy flower, seek not thy paradise\nin a fool's buttonhole.\n\nThou hast risen late, my crescent moon,\nbut my night bird is still awake to greet thee.\n\nDarkness is the veiled bride\nsilently waiting for the errant light\nto return to her bosom.\n\nTrees are the earth's endless effort to\nspeak to the listening heaven.\n\nThe burden of self is lightened\nwhen I laugh at myself.\n\nThe weak can be terrible \nbecause they try furiously to appear strong.\n\nThe wind of heaven blows,\nThe anchor desperately clutches the mud,\nand my boat is beating its breast against the chain.\n\nThe spirit of death is one,\nthe spirit of life is many,\nWhe God is dead religion becomes one.\n\nThe blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,\nthe wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\"\nDay's pain muffled by its own glare,\nburns among stars in the night.\n\nThe stars crowd round the virgin night\nin silent awe at her loneliness\nthat can never be touched.\n\nThe cloud gives all its gold\nto the departing sun\nand greets the rising moon\nwith only a pale smile.\n\nHe who does good comes to the temple gate,\nhe who loves reaches the shrine.\n\nFlower, have pity for the worm,\nit is not a bee,\nits love is a blunder and a burden.\n\nWith the ruins of terror's triumph\nchildren build their doll's house.\n\nThe lamp waits through the long day of neglect\nfor the flame's kiss in the night.\n\nFeathers in the dust lying lazily content\nhave forgotten their sky.\n\nThe flowers which is single\nneed not envy the thorns\nthat are numerous.\n\nThe world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny\nof its well-wisher.\n\nWe gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price\nfor our right to live.\n\nYour careless gifts of a moment,\nlike the meteors of an autumn night,\ncatch fire in the depth of my being.\n\nThe faith waiting in the heart of a seed\npromises a miracle of life\nwhich it cannot prove at once.\n\nSpring hesitates at winter's door,\nbut the mango blossom rashly runs our to him\nbefore her time and meets her doom.\n\nThe world is the ever-changing foam\nthet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.\n\nThe two separated shores mingle their voices\nin a song of unfathomed tears.\n\nAs a river in the sea,\nwork finds its fulfilment\nin the depth of leisure.\n\nI lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,\nbut the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.\n\nThy shy little pomegranate bud,\nblushing to-day behind her veil,\nwill burst into a passionate flower\nto-morrow when I am away.\n\nThe clumsiness of power spoils the key,\nand uses the pickaxe.\n\nBirth is from the mystery of night\ninto the grerater mystery of day.\n\nThese paper boats of mine are meant to dance\non the ripples of hours,\nand not to reach any destination.\n\nMigratory songs wing from my heart\nand seek their nests in your voice of love.\n\nThe sea of danger, doubt and denial\naround man's little island of certainty\nchallenges him to dare the unknown.\n\nLove punishes when it forgives,\nand injured beauty by its awful silence.\n\nYou live alone and unrecompensed\nbecause they are afraid of your great worth.\n\nThe same sun is newly born in new lands\nin a ring of endless dawns.\n\nGod is world is ever renewed by death,\na Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.\n\nThe glow-worm while exploring the dust\nnever knows that stars are in the sky.\n\nThe tree is of to-day, the flower is old,\nit brings with it the message\nof the immemorial seed.\n\nEach rose that comes brings me greetings\nfrom the Rose of an eternal spring.\nGod honours me when I work,\nHe loves me when I sing.\n\nMy love of to-day finds no home\nin the nest deserted by yesterday's love.\n\nThe fire of pain tracse for my soul\na luminous path across her sorrow.\n\nThe grass survives the hill\nthrough its resurrections from countless deaths.\n\nThou hast vanished from my reach\nleaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,\nan invisible image in the wind moving\namong the shadows.\n\nIn pity for the desolate branch\nspring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.\n\nThe shy shadow in the farden\nloves the sun in silence,\nFlowers guess the secret, and mile,\nwhile the leaves whisper.\n\nI leave no trace of wings in the air,\nbut I am glad I have had my flight.\n\nThe fireflies, twinkling among leaves,\nmake the stars wonder.\n\nThe mountain remains unmoved\nat its seeming defeat by the mist.\n\nWhile the rose said to the sun,\n\"I shall ever remember thee,\"\nher petals fell to the dust.\n\nHills are the earth's gesture of despair\nfor the unreachable.\n\nThough the thorn in thy flower pricked me,\nO Beauty,\nI am grateful.\n\nThe world knows that the few\nare more than the many.\n\nLet not my love be a burden on you, my friend,\nknow that it pays itself.\n\nDawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,\nand is content to vanish when the sun comes out.\n\nBeauty is truth's smile\nwhen she beholds her own face\nin a perfect mirror.\n\nThe dew-drop knows the sun\nonly within its own tiny orb.\n\nForlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,\nswarming in the air, hum round my heart\nand seek my voice.\n\nThe desert is imprisoned in the wall\nof its unbounded barrenness.\n\nIn the thrill of little leaves\nI see the air's invisible dance,\nand in their glimmering\nthe secret heart-beats of the sky.\n\nYou are like a flowering tree,\namazed when I praise you for your gifts.\n\nThe earth's sacrifical fire\nflames up in her trees,\nscattering sparks in flowers.\n\nForetsts, the clouds of earth,\nhold up to the sky their silence,\nand clouds from above come down\nin resonant showers.\n\nThe world speaks to me in pictures,\nmy soul answers in music.\n\nThe sky tells its beads all night\non the countless stars\nin memory of the sun.\n\nThe darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,\nthe darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.\n\nPride engraves his frowns in stones,\nloe offers her surrender in flowers.\n\nThe obsequious brush curtails truth\nin diference to the canvas which is narrow.\n\nThe hill in its longing for the far-away sky\nwishes to be like the cloud\nwith its endless urge of seeking.\n\nTo justify their own spilling of ink\nthey spell the day as night.\n\nProfit smiles on goodness\nwhen the good is profitable.\n\nIn its swelling pride\nthe bubble doubts the turth of the sea,\nand laughs and bursts into emptiness.\n\nLove is an endless mystery,\nfor it has nothing else to explain its.\n\nMy clouds, sorrowing in the dark,\nforget that they themselves\nhave hidden the sun.\n\nMan discovers his own wealth\nwhen God comes to ask gifts of him.\n\nYou leave your memory as a flame\nto my lonely lamp of separation.\n\nI came to offer thee a flower,\nbut thou must have all my garden,\u2014\nIt is thine.\n\nThe picture\u2014a memory of light\ntreasured by the shadow.\n\nIt is easy to make faces at the sun,\nHe is exposed by his own light in all\ndirections.\n\nHistory slowly smothers its truth,\nbut hastily struggles to revive it\nin the terrible penance of pain.\n\nMy work is rewarded in daily wages,\nI wait for my final value in love.\n\nBeauty knows to say, \"Enough,\"\nbarbarism clamours for still more.\n\nGod loves to see in me, not his servant,\nbut himself who serves all.\n\nThe darkness of night is in harmony with day,\nthe morning of mist is discordant.\n\nIn the bounteous time of roses love is wine,\u2014\nit is food in the famished hour\nwhen their petals are shed.\n\nAn unknown flower in a strange land\nspeaks to the poet:\n\"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"\n\nI am able to love my God\nbecause He gives me freedom to deny Him.\n\nMy untuned strings beg for music\nin their anguished cry of shame.\n\nThe worm thinks it strange and foolish\nthat man does not eat his books.\n\nThe clouded sky to-day bears the visior\nof the shadow of a divine sadness\non the forehead of brooding eternity.\n\nThe shade of my tree is for passers-by,\nits fruit for the one for whom I wait.\n\nFlushed with the glow of sunset\nearth seems like a ripe fruit\nready to be harvested by night.\n\nLight accepts darkness for his spouse\nfor the sake of creation.\n\nThe reed waits for his master's breath,\nthe Master goes seeking for his reed.\n\nTo the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,\nits writing unmeaning.\n\nThe sea smites his own barren breast\nbecause he has no flowers to offer to the moon.\n\nThe greed for fruit misses the flower.\n\nGod in His temple of stars\nwaits for man to bring him his lamp.\n\nThe fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.\nReleased from bonds, the shameless flame\ndies in barren ashes.\n\nThe sky sets no snare to capture the moon,\nit is her own freedom which binds her.\nThe light that fills the sky\nseeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.\n\nWealth is the burden of bigness,\nWelfare the fulness of being.\n\nThe razor-blade is proud of its keenness\nwhen it sneers at the sun.\n\nThe butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,\nnot the bee busily storing honey.\n\nChild, thou bringest to my heart\nthe babble of the wind and the water,\nthe flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,\nthe mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.\n\nThe rainbow among the clouds may be great\nbut the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.\n\nThe mist weaves her net round the morning,\ncaptivates him, and makes him blind.\n\nThe Morning Star whispers to Dawn,\n\"Tell me that you are only for me.\"\n\"Yes,\" she answers,\n\"And also only for that nameless flower.\"\n\nThe sky remains infinitely vacant\nfor earth there to build its heaven with dreams.\n\nPerhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt\nat being told that it is a fragment\nawaiting perfection.\n\nLet the evening forgive the mistakes of the day\nand thus win peace for herself.\n\nBeauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,\nin the heart of a sweet incompleteness.\n\nYour flitting love lightly brushed with its wings\nmy sun-flower\nand never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.\n\nLeaves are silences\naround flowers which are their words.\n\nThe tree bears its thousand years\nas one large majestic moment.\n\nMy offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,\nbut for the wayside shrines\nthat surprise me at every bend.\n\nHour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,\nis simple and inexplicable.\n\nDeath laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated\nfor it swells his store with more than he can claim.\n\nThe sigh of the shore follows in vain\nthe breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.\n\nTruth loves its limits,\nfor there it meets the beautiful.\n\nBetween the shores of Me and Thee\nthere is the loud ocean, my own surging self,\nwhich I long to cross.\n\nThe right to possess boasts foolishly\nof its right to enjoy.\n\nThe rose is a great deal more\nthan a blushing apology for the thorn.\n\nDay offers to the silence of stars\nhis golden lute to be tuned\nfor the endless life.\n\nThe wise know how to teach,\nthe fool how to smite.\n\nThe centre is still and silent in the heart\nof an enternal dance of circles.\n\nThe judge thinks that he is just when he compares\nThe oil of another's lamp\nwith the light of his own.\n\nThe captive flower in the King's wreath\nsmiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.\n\nIts store of snow is the hill's own burden,\nits outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.\n\nListen to the prayer of the forest\nfor its freedom in flowers.\n\nLet your love see me\neven through the barrier of nearness.\n\nThe spirit of work in creation is there\nto carry and help the spirit of play.\n\nTo carry the burden of the insturment,\ncount the cost of its material,\nand never to know that it is for music,\nis the tragedy of deaf life.\n\nFaith is the bird that feels the light\nand sings when the dawn is still dark.\n\nI bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,\nto be cleansed with thy cool darkness\nfor a new morning's festival.\n\nThe mountain fir, in its rustling,\nmodulates the memory of its fights with the storm\ninto a hymn of peace.\n\nGod honoured me with his fight\nwhen I was rebellious,\nHe ignored me when I was languid.\n\nThe sectarina thinks\nthat he has the sea\nladled into his private pond.\n\nIn the shady depth of life\nare the lonely nests of memories\nthat shrink from words.\n\nLet my love find its strength\nin the service of day,\nits peace in the union of night.\n\nLife sends up in blades of grass\nits silent hymn of praise\nto the unnamed Light.\n\nThe stars of night are to me\nthe memorials of my day's faded flowers.\n\nOpen thy door to that which must go,\nfor the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.\n\nTrue end is not in the reaching of the limit,\nbut in a completion which is limitless.\n\nThe shore whispers to the sea:\n\"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\"\nThe sea writes in foam again and again\nand wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.\n\nLet the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings\nand make the music thine and mine.\n\nThe inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,\nmatured in joy and sorrow,\nwill drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil\nfor some further course of creation.\n\nForm is in Matter, rhythm in Force,\nmeaning in the Person.\n\nThere are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,\nI seek thy company so that I may sing.\n\nAs the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth,\nlet my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.\n\nMy faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,\nhelp thee, Master, in thy creation.\n\nAll the delights that I have felt\nin life's fruits and flowers\nlet me offer to thee at the end of the feast,\nin a perfect union of love.\n\nSome have thought deeply and explored the\nmeaning of thy truth,\nand they are great;\nI have listened to catch the music of thy play,\nand I am glad.\n\nThe tree is a winged spirit\nreleased from the bondage of seed,\npursuing its adventure of life\nacross the unknown.\n\nThe lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,\nthe grass its service to the earth.\n\nThe sun's kiss mellows into abandonment\nthe miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.\n\nThe flame met the earthen lamp in me,\nand what a great marvel of light!\n\nMistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth\nand therefore delude us.\n\nThe cloud laughed at the rainbow\nsaying that is was an upstart\ngaudy in its emptiness.\nThe rainbow calmly answered,\n\"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"\n\nLet me not grope in vain in the dark\nbut keep my mind still in the faith\nthat the day will break\nand truth will appear\nin its simplicity.\n\nThrough the silent night\nI hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning\nknock at my heart.\n\nMy new love comes\nbringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.\n\nThe earth gazes at the moon and wonders\nthat she sould have all her music in her smile.\n\nDay with its glare of curiosity\nputs the stars to flight.\n\nMy mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky,\nat the window which is mine own,\nand not in the open\nwhere thou hast thy sole kingdom.\n\nMan claims God's flowers as his own\nwhen he weaves them in a garland.\n\nThe buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,\nis ashamed that is has lost all its song.\n\nLike my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,\nthe sun's rays robed in dark\nhide themselves under the ground.\nLike my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,\nthey change their veil at the spring's call\nand come out in the carnival of colours,\nin flowers and leaves.\n\nMy life's empty flute\nwaits for its final music\nlike the primal darkness\nbefore the stars came out.\n\nEmancipation from the bondage of the soil\nis no freedom for the tree.\n\nThe tapestry of life's story is woven\nwith the threads of life's ties\never joining and breaking.\n\nThose thoughts of mine that are never captured by words\nperch upon my song and dance.\n\nMy soul to-night loses itself\nin the silent heart of a tree\nstanding alone among the whispers of immensity.\n\nPearl shells cast up by the sea\non death's barren beach,\u2014\na magnificent wastefulness of creative life.\n\nThe sunlight opens for me the word's gate,\nlove's light its terasure.\n\nMy life like the reed with ist stops,\nhas its play od colours\nthrough the gaps in its hopes and gains.\n\nLet not my thanks to thee\nrob my silence of its fuller homage.\n\nLife's aspirations come\nin the guise of children.\n\nThe faded flower sighs\nthat the spring has vanished for ever.\n\nIn my life's garden\nmy wealth has been of the shadows and lights\nthat are never gathered and stored.\n\nThe fruit that I Have gained for ever\nis thet which thou hast accepted.\n\nThe jasmine knows the sun to be her brother\nin the heaven.\n\nLight is young, the ancient light;\nshadows are of the moment, they are born old.\n\nI feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end\nwill brong me across to the other shore\nfrom where I shall see.\n\nThe butterfly flitting from flower to flower\never remains mine,\nI lose the one that is netted by me.\n\nYour voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,\nand my drowsy wings dream\nof a voyage to the light\nabove the clouds.\n\nI miss the meaning of my own part\nin the play of life\nbecause I know not of the parts\nthat others play.\n\nThe flower sheds all its petals\nand finds the fruit.\n\nI leave my songs behind me \nto the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles\nand the joy of the wind from the south.\n\nDead leaves when they lose themselves in soil\ntake part in the life of the forest.\n\nThe mind ever seeks its words\nfrom its sounds and silence\nas the sky from its darkness and light.\n\nThe unseen dark plays on his flute\nand the rhythm of light\neddies into stars and suns,\ninto thoughts and reams.\n\nMy songs are to sing\nthat I have loved Thy singing.\n\nWhen the voice of the Silent touches my words\nI know him and therefore I know myself.\n\nMy last salutations are to them\nwho knew me imperfect and loved me.\n\nLove's gift cannot be given,\nit waits to be accepted.\n\nWhen death comes and whispers to me,\n\"Thy days are ended,\"\nlet me say to him, \"I have lived in love\nand not in mere time.\"\nHe will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\"\nI shall say, \"I know not, but this I know\nthat often when I sang I found my eternity.\"\n\n\"Let me light my lamp,\"\nsay the star,\n'and never debate\nif it will help to remove the darkness.\"\n\nBefore the end of my journey\nmay I reach within myself\nthe one which is the all,\nleaving the outer shell\nto float away with the drifting multitude\nupon the current of chance and change.\n",
